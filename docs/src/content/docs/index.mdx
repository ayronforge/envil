`@ayronforge/better-env` is a type-safe environment variable library built on [Effect Schema](https://effect.website/docs/schema/introduction). It validates your env vars at startup, gives you full TypeScript inference, and prevents client-side access to server secrets.

## Why better-env?

Environment variables are stringly-typed by default. A missing `DATABASE_URL` or a malformed `PORT` shouldn't crash your app deep in a request handler — it should fail **immediately** at startup with a clear error message.

**better-env** gives you:

- **Runtime validation** — every env var is parsed through Effect Schema at startup
- **Full type inference** — your `env` object is fully typed from your schema definitions, no manual annotations needed
- **Client/server separation** — define `server`, `client`, and `shared` buckets; accessing a server variable on the client throws at runtime
- **Framework presets** — pre-configured prefix rules for Next.js, Vite, and Expo
- **Cloud secret resolution** — pull env vars from AWS Secrets Manager, GCP, Azure Key Vault, or 1Password
- **Composable configs** — split env definitions across modules and merge them with `extends`

## Quick example

```ts
import { createEnv, port, requiredString, boolean } from "@ayronforge/better-env"
import { Schema } from "effect"

export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    DATABASE_URL: requiredString,
    PORT: port,
    DEBUG: boolean,
  },
  client: {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: requiredString,
  },
  shared: {
    NODE_ENV: Schema.Literal("development", "production", "test"),
  },
})

// Fully typed: env.DATABASE_URL is string, env.PORT is number
console.log(env.DATABASE_URL)
```

If any variable is missing or invalid, you get a clear error at startup:

```
EnvValidationError: Invalid environment variables:
DATABASE_URL: Expected a string with a length of at least 1, but got undefined
PORT: Expected Port (1-65535), but got "not-a-number"
```
